"""Sample prograam to illustrate (i) how to read a text file and (ii) how to get stuff from the net.

This program implements two functions:
1. Reads any text file and return s its contents as a single variable. It's then up to you to iterate through the file
and do something with its contents. Note that the file you are reading MUST be a text file.
2. Accepts a URL and attempts to return the resource. If it can't be decoded then we assume that it's not text and throw
an error. If the status code of the response isn't in the 200s (everything OK) or the 300s (OK but redirected) then we
also throw an error.
